# configs
These are my dotfiles.

## Install
See `dotfiles.py` for available dotfiles and bundles.

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/lorax42/configs.git
cd configs

./install.py nvim  # to install nvim configs
# OR
./install.py -b sway  # to install the sway bundle
```

## Future
- only replace dotfiles, that don't match the repo's
